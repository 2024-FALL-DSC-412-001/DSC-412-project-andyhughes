This project uses a linear regression model to try and predict a Nba team's
winning percentage for a given season. Some of the variables used are 
nba team statistics such as shot attempts, rebounds, points per game.

The dataset used is from a Kaggle dataset 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mharvnek/nba-team-stats-00-to-18?select=nba_team_stats_00_to_23.csv

Right now the linear regression model has been built. I may add other models and data analysis before Milestone 4.
